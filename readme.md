What I learned and used in the project:

Backend:

1. Made with MERN stack.
2. Learned how to make models using mongoose and use routes, middlewares and controllers.
3. Used the concept of RestAPIs and Postman for testing the backend.
4. Validated username, email and password using Zod Library.
5. Used bcryptjs for hashing the password (encrypting the pwd in database )
6. Authenticated credentials of user from DB.
7. Generated token for login and logout using JWT.
8. Used CORS middleware for connecting backend and frontend.
9. Used middlewares for authorization (user sees only their todos, and not someone else's)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
1. used react-router-dom package for defining routes of different pages like home, login, etc.
2. used axios for api handling in frontend
3. Use React Hot Toast for Prompts on screen
